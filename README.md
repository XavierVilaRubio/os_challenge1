##### The hypothesis is that the *Procedure call* will be more expensive because they throw a system call.

### Question 2
#### How much more expensive is a *System call* or a *Procedure call* respect the other?

### Question 3
#### Design an experiment to test and proof which call is more time expensive. Write a simple test program in C to compare the cost of a simple procedure call to a simple system call (i.e getpid()).
